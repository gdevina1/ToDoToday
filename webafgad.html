    <h2>Big Idea</h2>
    <p> We often find ourselves pondering on what to do on a Friday or Saturday night. Having to plan where to go every weekend is too much of a hassle. Hence, we came up with an idea to make a chatbot that will give us the result just by typing one question. We decided to do it on Facebook because Facebook has a complete user interface, hosted several bots such as NBA Awards, and have a large user base. </p>
